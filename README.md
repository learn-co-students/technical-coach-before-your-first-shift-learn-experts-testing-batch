# Before Your First Shift

Before you work your first shift, there a few tasks (aside from completing this curriculum track) you'll need to complete. The Technical Coach Lead (TCL) from your squad or another TCL will help you complete these.

## Shadowing and Observing a TC

Before jumping in with students, new TCs should shadow a few veteran TCs to get an idea of how we pair program with students over a screenshare. We recommend shadowing multiple TCs to see the different ways they work with students, as well as get a sense of best practices - from initiating communication with the student, running the screenshare, troubleshooting and teaching on the fly to wrapping up with the student. It may help to take notes during the sessions so you have material to review afterwards. Be sure to follow up with the TC you shadowed afterwards if you have any questions or comments for them.

If your TCL has not already reached out to you to schedule the shadowing sessions, please reach out to them to get the ball rolling!

## Mock Pair Programming Sessions

After your 3 TC observations, you'll roleplay in three mock pair programming sessions with a TCL, where you'll play the role of the Technical Coach and the TCL will play the role of the student. This will help get you accustomed to troubleshooting and teaching in a low pressure environment where you can immediately get feedback on your performance. This will also (ideally) make you more comfortable with the process, so by the time you're ready to do your first shift, you're ready to effectively work with students. The roleplays will likely cover a variety of topics, ranging from basic lab debugging to environment issues to teaching a student struggling conceptually. 

If your TCL has not already reached out to you to schedule the mock pair programming sessions, please reach out to them!
