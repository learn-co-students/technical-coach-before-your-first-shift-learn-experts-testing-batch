# Before Your First Shift

Before you work your first shift, there a few tasks (aside from completing this curriculum track) you'll need to complete. Your manager, Erika Hughes, will help you to complete these.

## Shadowing and Observing a TC

Before jumping in with students, new TCs should shadow a few veteran TCs to get an idea of how we pair program with students over a screenshare. We recommend shadowing multiple TCs to see the different ways they work with students, as well as get a sense of best practices - from initiating communication with the student, running the screenshare, troubleshooting and teaching on the fly to wrapping up with the student. It may help to take notes during the sessions so you have material to review afterwards. Be sure to follow up with the TC you shadowed afterwards if you have any questions or comments for them.

If Erika has not already reached out to you to schedule the shadowing sessions, please reach out to her to get the ball rolling!

## Mock Pair Programming Sessions

After your TC observations, you'll roleplay in several mock pair programming sessions with Erika, where you'll play the role of the Technical Coach and Erika will play the role of the student. This will help get you accustomed to troubleshooting and teaching in a low pressure environment where you can immediately get feedback on your performance. This will also (ideally) make you more comfortable with the process, so by the time you're ready to do your first shift, you're ready to effectively work with students. The roleplays will likely cover a variety of topics, ranging from basic lab debugging to environment issues to teaching a student struggling conceptually.

## Pairing With Students

After you've done your mock pair programming sessions, Erika will facilitate screen shares that you will then lead. You'll generally take more straightforward questions testing less complex coding concepts, to help build up your confidence and ease you into working with students. Erika will help you determine which questions might be better screen shares to start with! Although you will ultimately be directing the screen share with the student, Erika will remain on the call with you during the zoom meeting. As she shadows the call, she can provide help or advice to you over Slack if necessary, or if you have a question.
